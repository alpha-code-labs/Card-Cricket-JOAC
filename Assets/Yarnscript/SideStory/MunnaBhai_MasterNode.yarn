// Scene Setup - Day 1 at the tire shop during busy afternoon
After noticing the long line of bicycles waiting for repairs outside Munna Bhai's tire shop and hearing his mother mention how hard local mechanics work, Raju chooses to visit during the busy afternoon period to see if the skilled repairman might need assistance.

The narrow tire shop resonates with the rhythmic sounds of air pumps and the metallic clanging of tire irons as Raju approaches Munna Bhai's workspace, where dozens of bicycles in various stages of repair create an organized chaos that speaks to the neighborhood's complete dependence on this single skilled mechanic. Munna Bhai moves between deflated tires, puncture patches, and air pumps with practiced efficiency, but the sweat on his brow and the growing queue of customers suggest that even his years of experience are being overwhelmed by today's unexpectedly heavy demand for bicycle repairs.

<<SetCharacterExpression "MunnaBhai" "Sad">>
MunnaBhai: Arre beta, perfect timing, but also terrible timing! Everyone's bicycle needs repair at the same time, and I'm just one person with two hands. Look at this line - it's going to take me until midnight to fix all these punctures and tire problems.

<<SetCharacterExpression "Raju" "Excited">>
Raju: Munna bhai, you look completely exhausted! Is there anything I can do to help? I have some free time and I'd love to learn about bicycle repair work.

<<SetCharacterExpression "MunnaBhai" "Serious">>
MunnaBhai: Help? Beta, bicycle repair isn't child's play. These tires cost people their daily wages, puncture patches must be applied perfectly, and one mistake means a customer's bicycle fails on the road. This work feeds my family - it can't afford errors.

<<SetCharacterExpression "Raju" "Serious">>
Raju: I understand it's serious work, bhai. But I'm careful with tools and I learn quickly. Maybe I could start with something simple, just to help reduce your workload a little?

<<SetCharacterExpression "MunnaBhai" "Serious">>
MunnaBhai: Simple? Child, there's nothing simple about keeping people's transportation working! Every tire must hold perfect pressure, every patch must seal completely, every repair must last for months. One failed repair and people can't get to work, school, or market.

<<SetCharacterExpression "Raju" "Excited">>
Raju: That's exactly why I want to help, bhai! You provide such essential service to our entire neighborhood. Surely there's some small way I could assist without causing problems?

<<SetCharacterExpression "MunnaBhai" "Quizzical">>
MunnaBhai: You really want to learn about mechanical work? Even knowing how demanding customers can be when their transportation fails, how precise tire repair must be, how exhausting these long days become?

<<SetCharacterExpression "Raju" "Excited">>
Raju: I'm not afraid of hard work or demanding customers, bhai. My father always says that skilled trades are the foundation of any community, and I want to understand what that really means.

// Scene Conclusion
As Raju exits the busy tire shop with the sounds of ongoing mechanical work and customer negotiations filling his ears, he carries both deep appreciation for the complexity of bicycle repair operations and strengthened determination to prove that his offer represents genuine commitment to learning rather than casual curiosity.
