AryanSmiling																	
Story 2	Aryan	Angry Background Music 1	11	Day 2	Raju	Raju Serious	"It's a beautiful bat, but it's still just a piece of willow wood. The bat doesn't hit the boundaries - the batsman does. Equipment doesn't make you play better, practice and heart do."	RajuSerious

Sports Academy																	
Story 3	Coach Sharma	Angry Background Music 1	58	Day 6	Coach Sharma	Coach Sharma Smiling	"Three weeks now. Every single morning at 5 AM sharp, without fail, without complaint, without excuses. Even my academy students don't demonstrate this level of consistency."	CoachSharmaSmiling

Story 3	Coach Sharma	Angry Background Music 1	65	Day 6	Coach Sharma	Coach Sharma Smiling	"You've proven that dedication isn't limited to those who can afford premium training.

Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	1.1	Day 1	No character - Dialog Setup	Not Applicable	"The imposing gates of the prestigious Wellington Estate school rise before Raju like monuments to a world of privilege and opportunity that seems impossibly distant from his daily reality, yet the gleaming buildings and manicured grounds behind those barriers represent everything he dreams education might offer to someone willing to work for it. His worn clothes and dusty sandals mark him immediately as an outsider in this environment of wealth and social status, while his determined approach despite obvious class barriers reflects a hunger for knowledge that transcends economic circumstances."	Wellington Estate																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	2	Day 1	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Angry	"You there, boy. What are you doing loitering near this gate? This is private property, not a place for wandering street children to waste time staring at what they cannot have."	SunitaMadamAngry																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	3	Day 1	Raju	Raju Sad	"Ma'am, I wasn't loitering. I was just... looking. This school is so big and beautiful. I've never seen anything like it before. Do you really learn everything here?"	RajuSad																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	4	Day 1	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Angry	"Learn? This is not for wandering eyes seeking cheap entertainment, boy. Students here are from families who value education, discipline, and meaningful contribution to society. Not idle curiosity from children who should be focused on... more appropriate pursuits."	SunitaMadamAngry																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	5	Day 1	Raju	Raju Sad	"I study too, Ma'am. Every day after school. And I play cricket, but I know education is important. I read books from our local library whenever I can."	RajuSad																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	6	Day 1	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Angry	"Cricket? Hmph. Slum boys always think games and sports will magically lift them up from their circumstances. Let me tell you something, child - it is education, real education with proper guidance and family investment, that matters. Not fantasies about playing games for a living."	SunitaMadamAngry																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	7	Day 1	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Angry	"This school costs more per month than your family probably earns in six months. These children have tutors, proper books, family support, and futures planned from birth. You have none of that. Stop wasting time on impossible dreams and focus on realistic goals suited to your... situation."	SunitaMadamAngry

Wellington Estate																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	10	Day 2	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Angry	"You again? Didn't I make myself perfectly clear yesterday? Why do you persist in wasting your time here?

Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	11	Day 2	Raju	Raju Serious	"Ma'am, I didn't come to loiter or waste time. I came because I want to learn. I was wondering... do you have any books I could read? Even old ones that the school doesn't need anymore?"	RajuSerious																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	12	Day 2	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Quizzical	"Books? You can even read properly? Most children from your... background struggle with basic literacy, let alone advanced literature."	SunitaMadamQuizzical

That's from Rabindranath Tagore's 'Where the Mind is Without Fear.'"	RajuSerious

Cricket makes me dream about possibilities, Ma'am, but books... books make me think about how to turn dreams into plans. They show me that people have overcome worse circumstances than mine."	RajuSerious																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	18	Day 2	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Quizzical	...Interesting. Very interesting. Most children from your background wouldn't bother with literature or philosophy. They usually focus on immediate survival rather than intellectual development.	SunitaMadamQuizzical																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	19	Day 2	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Smiling	Your library visits and poetry knowledge suggest something I didn't expect to find. Perhaps I was... hasty in my initial judgment yesterday.	SunitaMadamSmiling

Wellington Estate																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	23a	Day 3a	Raju	Raju Excited	"I want to prove my academic abilities through serious study, Ma'am. Test my knowledge in any subject. Give me the hardest questions you have - literature, mathematics, science, history."	RajuExcited																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	24a	Day 3a	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Serious	Bold words. Most children your age avoid difficult subjects. You're asking me to evaluate you at the same level I would test my privileged students?	SunitaMadamSerious																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	25a	Day 3a	Raju	Raju Excited	"Yes, Ma'am. I may not have expensive tutors, but I have curiosity and determination. I want to prove that intellectual ability isn't limited by economic circumstances."	RajuExcited																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	26a	Day 3a	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Serious	Very well. Let's start with literary analysis. Explain the social commentary in Premchand's stories. Show me you understand literature beyond surface level.	SunitaMadamSerious																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	27a	Day 3a	Raju	Raju Serious	"Premchand shows how poverty shapes moral choices, Ma'am. His characters aren't evil - they're trapped by circumstances. Like in 'Kafan' - the father and son represent how social conditions can corrupt basic human dignity."	RajuSerious																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	28a	Day 3a	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Smiling	Sophisticated analysis. You understand subtext and social criticism. This level of comprehension typically requires formal instruction.	SunitaMadamSmiling																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	28a.1	Day 3a	No character - Dialog Setup	Not Applicable	"As Raju demonstrates academic capabilities that exceed Sunita Madam's expectations through sophisticated literary analysis and critical thinking, both teacher and student recognize that something significant has shifted in their relationship - from dismissive prejudice to genuine academic engagement. His choice to prove himself through intellectual rigor rather than emotional appeals has validated his belief that merit can overcome social barriers when properly demonstrated and fairly evaluated."	Wellington Estate																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	23b	Day 3b	Raju	Raju Serious	"Let me prove my character through respectful service, Ma'am. I want to earn your trust gradually. Perhaps I could help with school tasks, show my dedication through actions rather than words."	RajuSerious																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	24b	Day 3b	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Quizzical	Service? You're offering to work without payment to prove your worthiness? That's... unusual for someone your age.	SunitaMadamQuizzical																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	25b	Day 3b	Raju	Raju Serious	"My mother taught me that respect is earned through consistent good behavior, Ma'am. I want to show you the same dignity and reliability she shows in her work."	RajuSerious																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	26b	Day 3b	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Smiling	Your mother sounds like a wise woman. What kind of service are you offering? And why do you think this would change my opinion?	SunitaMadamSmiling																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	27b	Day 3b	Raju	Raju Serious	"I could help organize books, clean classroom spaces, assist with small tasks. I want to show that I understand the value of this educational environment and would treat it with proper respect."	RajuSerious																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	28b	Day 3b	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Smiling	Your respectful attitude and willingness to serve without immediate reward shows maturity beyond your years. Perhaps there's more character here than I initially recognized.	SunitaMadamSmiling																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	28b.1	Day 3b	No character - Dialog Setup	Not Applicable	"As Raju demonstrates his commitment through offers of humble service rather than demanding recognition based on potential alone, Sunita Madam begins to see qualities that transcend social class - reliability, respect, and genuine appreciation for educational opportunity. His approach reflects lessons learned from his mother about earning respect through consistent character, transforming what could have been seen as servility into evidence of mature understanding about how relationships and trust develop over time."	Wellington Estate																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	23c	Day 3c	Raju	Raju Excited	"I'll prove that determination can overcome any barrier, Ma'am. Watch me work harder than anyone. Give me the most challenging assignments - I'll complete them all and ask for more."	RajuExcited																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	24c	Day 3c	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Quizzical	"Determination without direction often leads to wasted effort, boy. What makes you think pure willpower can substitute for proper resources and guidance?"	SunitaMadamQuizzical																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	25c	Day 3c	Raju	Raju Excited	"Because I've already overcome obstacles others said were impossible, Ma'am. I've taught myself to read advanced books, balanced cricket with studies, earned respect from adults who initially dismissed me."	RajuExcited																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	26c	Day 3c	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Serious	Give me specific examples. How exactly have you overcome these obstacles? What concrete achievements demonstrate this determination?	SunitaMadamSerious																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	27c	Day 3c	Raju	Raju Excited	"I memorized poetry from library books, learned cricket techniques through observation and practice, convinced my father to support my dreams by proving academic responsibility. Every success came from refusing to accept limitations."	RajuExcited																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	28c	Day 3c	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Smiling	Your persistence is remarkable. Most children give up when faced with significant challenges. This level of determination might indeed overcome many barriers.	SunitaMadamSmiling																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	28c.1	Day 3c	No character - Dialog Setup	Not Applicable	"As Raju articulates his track record of overcoming obstacles through sheer determination and systematic effort, Sunita Madam begins to understand that his confidence stems not from naive optimism but from demonstrated ability to achieve goals that seemed impossible. His examples of previous successes in diverse areas - academic, athletic, and familial - provide concrete evidence that his claims about overcoming barriers through persistence reflect genuine capability rather than empty boasting."

Wellington Estate																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	30	Day 4	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Smiling	Persistent boy. I honestly thought you would give up after our previous conversations. Most children your age lose interest when adults don't immediately embrace their dreams.	SunitaMadamSmiling																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	31	Day 4	Raju	Raju Serious	"I can't give up, Ma'am. Not on learning, not on cricket, not on proving that I can be more than people expect from someone like me. Giving up would mean accepting that my circumstances define my possibilities."	RajuSerious																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	32	Day 4	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Serious	And what exactly do you hope to prove through these daily visits? That determination alone can overcome structural barriers? That good intentions substitute for proper resources and guidance?	SunitaMadamSerious																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	33	Day 4	Raju	Raju Excited	"I want to prove that talent and character matter more than family wealth, Ma'am. Look, I've been writing down questions about subjects I want to understand better - mathematics, history, literature, even science."	RajuExcited																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	34	Day 4	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Excited	These are thoughtful questions. Sophisticated questions. 'How do economic systems affect educational opportunities?' 'What role does literature play in social change?' Most of my paying students don't demonstrate this level of intellectual curiosity.	SunitaMadamExcited																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	35	Day 4	Raju	Raju Excited	"So... you think I might have potential, Ma'am? Even though I'm from the slum?"	RajuExcited																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	36	Day 4	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Smiling	"Perhaps I was too harsh in my initial judgments. It's easy to judge a child by his clothes and circumstances rather than by what's visible in his eyes and actions. But I see real determination there, genuine intellectual hunger."	SunitaMadamSmiling																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	37	Day 4	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Smiling	"You know, boy, I've taught thousands of children over the years.

SunitaMadamSmiling																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	38	Day 4	Raju	Raju Excited	"Then you'll help me learn, Ma'am? You'll give me a chance to prove that I can succeed despite my background?"	RajuExcited

Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	43	Day 5	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Serious	You're asking me to become your informal tutor?

Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	44	Day 5	Raju	Raju Serious	"I know it's a lot to ask, Ma'am. But I'm willing to work harder than any paying student. I'll read whatever you recommend, practice whatever exercises you suggest, and prove that your investment in me isn't wasted."	RajuSerious																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	45	Day 5	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Serious	"Commitment is easy to promise, boy. But educational guidance requires consistent effort over months and years. It means accepting criticism, working through difficult material, and persisting when progress feels slow."	SunitaMadamSerious																	
Story 8	Sunita Madam	Light Background Music 3	46	Day 5	Sunita Madam	Sunita Madam Serious	My reputation has been built on producing successful students from privileged backgrounds.

Story 9	Suresh	Light Background Music 3	6	Day 1	Suresh	Suresh Sad	"Dreams cost money, beta. More money than families like ours usually have. When I was your age, my cricket was improving every month. Coaches were talking about state-level selections, maybe even further opportunities. But then my father got sick - really sick. Hospital bills, medicines, no income while he couldn't work."	SureshSad																	
Story 9	Suresh	Light Background Music 3	7	Day 1	Suresh	Suresh Serious	"Someone had to step up and support the family. Cricket doesn't feed hungry stomachs or pay medical bills. Auto driving does. So I chose responsibility over dreams, and I've never regretted that choice - but I've never forgotten what I gave up either."	SureshSerious																	
Story 9	Suresh	Light Background Music 3	8	Day 1	Raju	Raju Excited	"I'm sorry about your father, bhaiya. But I'll find a way to make cricket work. I'll find scholarships, sponsors, something. I won't let money stop me from playing."	RajuExcited

The harsh realities that Suresh shared about dreams deferred by family responsibilities have forced Raju to examine his own motivations and consider whether his cricket ambitions represent genuine calling or merely youthful fantasy, while his return to continue the conversation demonstrates a maturity that recognizes learning from others' experiences."

Story 9	Suresh	Light Background Music 3	16a	Day 2a	Suresh	Suresh Smiling	"Now that's mature thinking, beta. Most boys hear my story and either get discouraged or make unrealistic promises. You're talking about learning from experience and strategic planning."	SureshSmiling																	
Story 9	Suresh	Light Background Music 3	17a	Day 2a	Raju	Raju Serious	"You had to choose between cricket and family needs.

Story 9	Suresh	Light Background Music 3	18b	Day 2b	Suresh	Suresh Serious	"Passion is powerful, champ, but the world doesn't always reward the most passionate person. Sometimes it rewards the most strategic one. How will you channel that fire effectively?"	SureshSerious

Sports Academy																	
Story 10	Naresh	Light Background Music 3	31a	Day 4a	Raju	Raju Excited	"I want to show you more of my cricket analysis, bhaiya. Let me prove my understanding goes deeper. I've been studying ball physics, different pitch conditions, even player psychology from watching their reactions."	RajuExcited																	
Story 10	Naresh	Light Background Music 3	32a	Day 4a	Naresh	Naresh Excited	"Ball physics? Player psychology? You're approaching cricket like a university course, beta. Most coaches don't teach these advanced concepts until much later."	NareshExcited																	
Story 10	Naresh	Light Background Music 3	33a	Day 4a	Raju	Raju Excited	I've noticed that successful batsmen read the bowler's grip and wrist position before the ball is even released. It's like solving puzzles - every movement gives clues about what's coming next.	RajuExcited																	
Story 10	Naresh	Light Background Music 3	34a	Day 4a	Naresh	Naresh Excited	"Show me these observations about reading bowlers. If you've truly identified patterns that predict delivery types, that's professional-level cricket intelligence."	NareshExcited

Sports Academy																	
Story 10	Naresh	Light Background Music 3	31c	Day 4c	Raju	Raju Excited	"I want to share my cricket dreams with you, bhaiya. Help me understand how to make them real. You see cricket at its highest level every day - guide me toward that same excellence."	RajuExcited																	
Story 10	Naresh	Light Background Music 3	32c	Day 4c	Naresh	Naresh Serious	"Dreams are fragile things, beta. I've seen many young cricketers with big ambitions but little understanding of what it takes to achieve them. What makes your dreams different?"	NareshSerious																	
Story 10	Naresh	Light Background Music 3	33c	Day 4c	Raju	Raju Excited	"Because cricket isn't just what I want to do, bhaiya - it's who I am.

Story 10	Naresh	Light Background Music 3	34c	Day 4c	Naresh	Naresh Smiling	"I can hear it in your voice, beta. That hunger for excellence, that need to be part of something greater than yourself. I felt the same way once, before circumstances changed my path."	NareshSmiling

Story 10	Naresh	Light Background Music 3	39	Day 5	Raju	Raju Excited	"I've been thinking about something I observed yesterday, bhaiya. When students practice their drives, they focus on power, but the most successful shots seem to emphasize timing and placement over force. Is that because of the equipment quality, or is it a fundamental technique principle?"	RajuExcited																	
Story 10	Naresh	Light Background Music 3	40	Day 5	Naresh	Naresh Serious	"That's... that's actually a very sophisticated observation, beta. You're identifying the difference between amateur enthusiasm and professional competence. Power without control is just wild hitting."	NareshSerious																	
Story 10	Naresh	Light Background Music 3	41	Day 5	Naresh	Naresh Excited	"See, most people think cricket is about strength, but it's really about understanding physics - angles, timing, momentum transfer. The expensive equipment here allows for precision that rough gear can't match, but the fundamental principle is the same."	NareshExcited																	
Story 10	Naresh	Light Background Music 3	42	Day 5	Raju	Raju Excited	"So proper technique could work with any equipment, but better equipment makes proper technique more effective?"	RajuExcited

Story 10	Naresh	Light Background Music 3	50	Day 6	Naresh	Naresh Smiling	Watch this. I'm going to demonstrate something about grip and stance that most students here take months to understand.	NareshSmiling																	
Story 10	Naresh	Light Background Music 3	51	Day 6	Naresh	Naresh Serious	"See how I'm holding the bat? Not just with my hands, but with my entire body engaged. The grip determines everything else - balance, power transfer, shot selection. Most people focus on the swing, but cricket really starts with the setup."	NareshSerious																	
Story 10	Naresh	Light Background Music 3	52	Day 6	Raju	Raju Excited	Your stance looks different from what the students here use. More... compact? Balanced?	RajuExcited
